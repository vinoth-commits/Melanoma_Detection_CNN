# Melanoma Classification
Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution which can evaluate images and alert the dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.

## Project Overview
This project builds a CNN model to classify melanoma skin lesions into 9 different categories.

## Dataset
The dataset contains training and test images categorized into 9 classes.

## Model Training
The model is trained using TensorFlow with data augmentation and class imbalance handling.

## Results
The model is evaluated based on accuracy and loss metrics.

## Instructions to Run
1. Ensure TensorFlow and required libraries are installed.
2. Place dataset in the specified directory.
3. Run the script.
4. The trained model will be saved as `melanoma_cnn_model.h5`
